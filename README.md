Register Screen

When user succesfully logs in there is a side navigation drawer with three fragments with home one set to ICO_live.Basically we again use retrofit to show our fake JSON api data using a nested scroll view on the screen.
There are 2 php files also login.php and register.php which are used in connection to the loacal server.
